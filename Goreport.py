Name:      GoReport v3.1
Author:    Christopher Maddalena

This is part script and part class for interfacing with the GoPhish API. You provide an API key
and host (e.g. https://ip:port) in a ``gophish.config`` file for the connection.

Then provide a campaign ID as a command line argument along with your preference for the
report type: python3 goreport.py --id 36 --format word

The results will be fetched and put through additional processing. An Excel xlsx or Word docx file
is created with all of the campaign details and some of the settings that may be of interest
(e.g. SMTP hostname and other basic info). The class also performs some analysis data points, like
the browser user-agents and IP addresses, to generate statistics for browser versions, operating
systems, and locations.
